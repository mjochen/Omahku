Code for a fledgling home automation-system.

## Arduino examples

... are the examples that work on the boards you'll be getting on Thursday. They receive a DHCP-ip and print it (serial), and when you push a button an LED (or a relais) goes on or off. The code for normal (not mega) also receives a percentage serially and then dims the light bulb.

The Sonoff is flashed with tasmota. You can fully reconfigure it if needed.
